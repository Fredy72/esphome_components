# custom_components

In order to use these components, you have two options:
1. clone this repo directly into your `config` directory. (For users with Home Assistant ad Samba addon this is \\<ip>\config\esphome )  This will make all of the components available.
2. clone it somewhere else, create a `custom_components` directory in your `config` diretory (For users with Home Assistant ad Samba addon this is \\<ip>\config\esphome ), and then copy the specific component directories that you want into there.
